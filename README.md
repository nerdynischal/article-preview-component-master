## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass/SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Mostly practiced a bit of JavaScript, particularly DOM manipulation. The most challenging part was getting the share button to behave a bit differently on mocile and desktop, which I eventually got there with mostly controling breakpoints in CSS.
